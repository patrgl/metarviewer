# metarviewer
Simple Python script to see a METAR with GUI.

Using PySimpleGUI and PythonMetar, I've created a simple script that allows you to input an airport's ICAO code and then show its latest netar.

# What is a METAR?
METAR is a format for reporting weather information. A METAR weather report is predominantly used by aircraft pilots, and by meteorologists, who use aggregated METAR information to assist in weather forecasting.
